    /* This class handles the reception processing of received RTP packets. It 
     * utilizes function dispatching to other classes to achieve this.

     * The point of reception flow is to provide isolation between different layers
     * of uvgRTP. For example, HEVC handler should not concern itself with RTP packet validation
     * because that should be a global operation done for all packets. Neither should Opus handler
     * take SRTP-provided authentication tag into account when it is performing operations on
     * the packet and ZRTP packets should not be relayed from media handler
     * to ZRTP handler et cetera.
     *
     * This can be achieved by having a global UDP packet handler for any packet type that validates
     * all common stuff it can and then dispatches the validated packet to the correct layer using
     * one of the installed handlers.
     *
     * If it's unclear as to which handler should be called, the packet is dispatched to all relevant
     * handlers and a handler then returns RTP_OK/RTP_PKT_NOT_HANDLED based on whether the packet was handled.
     *
     * For example, if receiver detects an incoming ZRTP packet, that packet is immediately dispatched to the
     * installed ZRTP handler if ZRTP has been enabled.
     * Likewise, if RTP packet authentication has been enabled, processor validates the packet before passing
     * it onto any other layer so all future work on the packet is not done in vain due to invalid data
     *
     * One piece of design choice that complicates the design of packet dispatcher a little is that the order
     * of handlers is important. First handler must be ZRTP and then follows SRTP, RTP and finally media handlers.
     * This requirement gives packet handler a clean and generic interface while giving a possibility to modify
     * the packet in each of the called handlers if needed. For example SRTP handler verifies RTP authentication
     * tag and decrypts the packet and RTP handler verifies the fields of the RTP packet and processes it into
     * a more easily modifiable format for the media handler.
     *
     * If packet is modified by the handler but the frame is not ready to be returned to user,
     * handler returns RTP_PKT_MODIFIED to indicate that it has modified the input buffer and that
     * the packet should be passed onto other handlers.
     *
     * When packet is ready to be returned to user, "out" parameter of packet handler is set to point to
     * the allocated frame that can be returned and return value of the packet handler is RTP_PKT_READY.
     *
     * If a handler receives a non-null "out", it can safely ignore "packet" and operate just on
     * the "out" parameter because at that point it already contains all needed information. */
